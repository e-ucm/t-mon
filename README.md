## Introduction

**T-Mon: Traces Monitor in xAPI-SG**

**T-Mon** is a set of Jupyter Notebooks to process data in the **xAPI-SG** data format. 
T-Mon loads [xAPI-SG](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics/wiki/xAPI-SG-Profile) statements (traces), analyzes them, and displays a default set of visualizations that provide a quick overview of its contents.

T-MON aims to display information as a quick overview for multiple stakeholers (game developers, teachers applying games, data scientist with little previous game knowledge).

Visualizations are better design to fit data of about **20-30 students** (average class size), although many of the visualizations which display aggregated data also work for larger datasets.

## Usage

### 1. Select your mode

The main Jupyter Notebook of T-Mon is **[T-Mon.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/e-ucm/t-mon/blob/master/T-Mon.ipynb)**. In the first line of the notebook:

* set `local = True` if you are hosting your own Jupyter server locally.
* set `local = False` to work with a web-hosted Jupyter server.

Keep `storage = file`. You can execute the xAPI-SG Processor and interact with it online using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/e-ucm/t-mon/master?filepath=T-Mon.ipynb).

### 2. Select xAPI-SG traces file

When running the **[T-Mon.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/e-ucm/t-mon/blob/master/T-Mon.ipynb)** notebook, you will see a widget file selector. 

* If using local mode, the selector will allow you to navigate in your local directory. JSON files will be highlighted in green.

![local upload](docs/images/local%20upload.png)

* If using remote mode, you will be able to upload your data file. 

![remote upload](docs/images/remote%20upload.png)

In any case, choose your JSON file containing a list of xAPI-SG statements.

### 3. Run the analysis

Finally, run the analysis.
 
After selected, all xAPI-SG statements in your JSON file will be processed (the Jupyter Notebook [ProcessxAPISGStatement.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/e-ucm/t-mon/blob/master/ProcessxAPISGStatement.ipynb) processes each xAPI-SG statement). 

With the information extracted from the statements, the default set of visualizations will be displayed in different tabs in the notebook. See below for details about the visualizations included.

## SIMVA

![simva logo](docs/images/logo-simva.png)

The xAPI-SG Processor can also connect with **[SIMVA](https://github.com/e-ucm/simva-infra)** to analyze the traces stored there as part of experiments.

To connect with SIMVA and analyze the xAPI-SG traces files stored there:

1. Previous requirements:
  * Download the tar.gz file of the [ipyauth release with KeyCloak support](https://github.com/e-ucm/ipyauth/releases/download/0.2.6-eucm.2/ipyauth-0.2.6-eucm.2.tar.gz)
  * Install ipyauth:
  ```
  pip install ipyauth.tar.gz
  jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipyauth.ipyauth_widget
  jupyter serverextension enable --py --sys-prefix ipyauth.ipyauth_callback
  ```
   * Install other dependencies required by the Notebook ([boto3](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/) and [jwt](https://pypi.org/project/jwt/)):
  ```
  pip install boto3 jwt
  ```
  
2. The main Jupyter Notebook to use is **[T-Mon-SIMVA.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/e-ucm/t-mon/blob/master/T-Mon-SIMVA.ipynb)**.  
1. Run the first cell in the notebook. A "Sign in" button will appear in the output. 
1. Click the "Sign in" button, it will pop up a window when you need to enter your **SIMVA credentials**. 
1. Once you have signed in, run the following cells. Keep `storage = simva`, so you will be able to access all traces JSON files available in your SIMVA account.
1. Select your activity id and the `traces.json` file.
1. Run the analysis.

## xAPI-SG

The **Experience API Profile for Serious Games (xAPI-SG)** is a validated xAPI Profile to collect information from serious games. 
Each xAPI-SG statement (trace) represents an activity in the context of a serious game.

For more information about the xAPI-SG Profile, you may visit:
* The **official [Profile repository](https://github.com/e-ucm/xapi-seriousgames)**
* Our [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics/wiki/xAPI-SG-Profile)
* The [journal publication](https://pubman.e-ucm.es/drafts/e-UCM_draft_297.pdf) about the xAPI-SG Profile.

To generate random xAPI-SG data, you may also try our [xAPI-SG data generator](https://github.com/e-ucm/xapi-sg-data-generator).
